    <h3>"When it started"</h3>
    <p><b>Long before Tony Hawk or Christian Hosoi began carving up half pipes, there were longboards.
         Longboarding originated in Hawaii in the 1950s, where surfers customized their skateboards, 
         giving them longer decks and larger wheels to mimic the rolling motion of waves and balance
         required by surfing. This enabled surfers to take to the streets on days when the ocean was 
         too choppy or the surf too low and is the reason longboarding is also referred to as “sidewalk surfing.”

<h3>"The Longboards Resurgance"</h3>
 <p><i>The growing popularity of skateboarding, which led to professional skateboarders becoming household names,
      carried on well into the 1990s. Around this time, snowboarding also began to gain traction as an alternative
       to skiing. This momentum led to something of a renaissance for longboarding. Compared to skateboarding, which
        was typically done competitively, longboarding became a fun and effective mode of transportation across city
        streets and sidewalks. Snowboarders also began to embrace longboarding as a way to refine their balance and
         coordination skills during the spring and summer seasons.</i></p>
